## About this library

We are at the very early stages of building this library. The API will change, things will break, and there are certainly bugs. You probably shouldn't use this for anything.

- Our primary goal is to make MATSim play nice with **pandas** and **geopandas**, for data analysis workflows.
- We have only tested this using Anaconda Python. Only Python 3.x is supported.
- Currently MATSim network, event, and plans files are supported. Hopefully more will be coming soon.
- For Geopandas network support, you also need to install `geopandas` and `shapely`.
- Supports JSON and Protobuf event file formats
- Can write MATSim files too!

## Quickstart

1. Install using `pip install matsim-tools`

2. In lieu of real documentation, here is some sample code to get you started. Good luck!
